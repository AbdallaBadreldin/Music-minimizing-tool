# Music-minimizing-tool

It was made specially for: 
Android 4.2.2,Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom (API level 17)

The main problem in this device that when user trys to minimize music it stops , so I made this tools to minimize music and keep sound works in background

It's very simple to use.

1) First you need to open the app and active the notification:
